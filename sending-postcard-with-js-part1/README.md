## Starting the App

This app is broken into two section -- the frontend and backend. To start the frontend section, change into the `frontend` directory and run `npm install`. Ater that, run `npm run dev` to start the Vue3 app. You will be able to see the frontend on `localhost:3000`. You will need to fill in the `.env` file with the values from Cloudinary. 

To start the backend section, change into the `backend` directory and run `npm isntall`. You will need to fill the `.env` file with your own Lob API key. After that run `npm run-script dev` to start the NodeJS server on `localhost:3030`.
